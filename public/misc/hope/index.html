    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Sonal was doing her yoga in hall and Samu was quite active as it was morning.
He wanted to do everything but sleep. It is usually his nap time but he wasn&rsquo;t feeling sleepy.
So, I took him to guest room (which is attached to hall).
I was hip carrying Samu, strolling and singing <code>Are Kanha, Are Krishna</code> angaai (lullaby) so that he would sleep.</p>
<p>The room&rsquo;s door wasn&rsquo;t fully closed. So, everytime I would pass by that door opening, he could see his mummy (Sonal).
He would get active again and hopeful that his mum would come to carry him. He would stretch his neck to see more of his mum.
This happened few times. So, I decided to close the door completely.</p>
<p>Once the door was closed, the hope was killed too. There wasn&rsquo;t any opening, so he couldn&rsquo;t see his mum.
He slowly diverted his attention to other things in room. His toys, mirror, books, &hellip; But those weren&rsquo;t too exciting.
In some time, he started saying <code>aaa aaa</code> while I was singing angaai as if he is also singing.
But the monotony in his voice tells you that he is about to fall asleep in some time.
When he doesn&rsquo;t want to fall asleep, his voice has excitement and his legs press against your body with force.
Nothing of that sort was happening, so he would fall asleep in some time.</p>
<p>After about 10 rounds of strolling, he fell asleep. But he kept jerking (pushing his head backwards) while sleeping.
So, I started patting around his neck instead of his back. His jerking stopped and he let his body loose on my shoulder.
In few minutes he completely fell asleep.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again at night, Samu was shreiking a lot. It was 11:15pm, by which he usually sleeps.
He didn&rsquo;t want to sleep as lights were on and movie sound was coming. So, I turned off lights and took him again in the guest room.
With complete darkness in the room, I expected Samu to get litle afraid but he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anything.
He was trying to gauge things with his hands. Usually he would try to press his legs against my body and try to get out of hands,
but he was just in my hands and trying to gauge things without much movement.
Within few rounds, he kept his head on my shoulder and fell asleep. I knew he wasn&rsquo;t asleep because his legs weren&rsquo;t loose.
In just 2 rounds, he woke up completely and was looking around as if I had come out the room. To his disappointment, I was still in the room so he fell asleep again.
This time again he suddenly woke up after 3 rounds. Still we were in the same room so he again fell asleep.
I was singing angaai and strolling slowly. It had been 5 rounds still he didn&rsquo;t wake up. I knew he didn&rsquo;t sleep but he didn&rsquo;t wake up after 5 rounds so I was also doubtful.
I kept strolling. 10 rounds, still he didn&rsquo;t wake up. But I could feel the tension in his legs. When he sleeps they are completely free unlike this time.
And suddenly after 12-13 rounds he wakes up. It was surprising, but I was prepared for it. He had been acting of sleeping all along.
He hadn&rsquo;t fallen asleep but was waiting for a chance from 12-13 rounds. So, much planning for a 1 year kid. It made me smile too.
But after being disappointed this time, he started yawning. Now he had given up and accepted that it&rsquo;s sleep time.
After few rounds of strolling, he slowly went to sleep and this time for real.</p>
<hr>
<p>Samu has strong body thanks to his mum&rsquo;s yoga. He also has a very sharp mind, evident from today&rsquo;s incident.
What else do you want in your child ? Rest all is your effort in shaping such a sharp mind and strong body.</p>
