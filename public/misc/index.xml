      <title>Closing the door on Hope</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sonal was doing her yoga in hall and Samu was quite active as it was morning.&#xA;He wanted to do everything but sleep. It is usually his nap time but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling sleepy.&#xA;So, I took him to guest room (which is attached to hall).&#xA;I was hip carrying Samu, strolling and singing &lt;code&gt;Are Kanha, Are Krishna&lt;/code&gt; angaai (lullaby) so that he would sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The room&amp;rsquo;s door wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully closed. So, everytime I would pass by that door opening, he could see his mummy (Sonal).&#xA;He would get active again and hopeful that his mum would come to carry him. He would stretch his neck to see more of his mum.&#xA;This happened few times. So, I decided to close the door completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Will we be able to do such a long travel ? What if Samu falls sick and we need to rush to hospital ? Where will we find hospital in a new city ?&#xA;What if Sonal falls sick ? How will we take care of Samu ? What if I fall sick ? How will we come back without driving from so far ?&#xA;What if some accident happens and whole family is injured ? What if car breaks down in journey ? What if we encounter some thief ? &amp;hellip; and what not.&#xA;All such negative thoughts were looming over head before the journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
