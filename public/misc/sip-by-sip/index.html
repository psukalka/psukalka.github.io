    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>There was something off about Samu today. We had gone to Vikas&rsquo; home for his daughter&rsquo;s birthday.
Samu kept crying there every now and then. We also left the function early and were thinking of taking Samu to hospital.
Probably there was some issue with his stomach. Maybe gas or something, is what we assumed.</p>
<p>While driving back home, Samu&rsquo;s crying continued in car too. This is unusual for Samu. He usually does not cry in car.
So, we played his favorite <code>Aha Tamatar bade mazedar</code> song and he kept quiet for some time. But he needed constant feeding.
Sonal was also getting agitated by this behaviour as it was her period day.</p>
<p>On coming home, we did some walking. Samu was crying during that too. I thought he wants to play, so I came back upstairs in 20 minutes.
Even after coming home, he was inconsolable. We played his jumping monkey. He would stop crying only when monkey was jumping.
Once it stopped he would start crying again.</p>
<p>I tried to make him sleep by singing lullaby. But that too didn&rsquo;t help today. Sonal came up after half hour and fed Samu.
After feeding when I tried to make him sleep, he again started crying. It was already 12am which is beyond his sleeping time.
He kept crying frequently. I again took him to Sonal for feeding after 15 min. Sonal was studying for her exam but still she fed him.
I again tried to make him sleep but he wasn&rsquo;t sleeping.</p>
<p>I felt thirsty so I brought water bottle and drank some water. Samu was looking at me so I gave him water too.
He drank one sip and then got out of my lap to play with bottle. I again settled sleep on my lap, gave him one sip of water.
He drank it and then got out of lap to play with bottle. I again made him sleep on my lap, gave him one sip of water.
Every time he would get up after drinking one sip. Usually I don&rsquo;t give him another sip after he gets out of lap but this time I kept giving him water.
I gave him about 20 sips of water. After that he refused to take another sip. So, I stopped.</p>
<p>Just 2 min after drinking water he burped. He was playing. He yawned in few minutes. His crying had stopped.
And within 5 min he fell asleep too. So, all along he was thirsty throughout the day. He was asking for water but I didn&rsquo;t understand.
He kept crying and we kept feeding him milk and food. He would drink only one sip of water and then not after that so we didn&rsquo;t give him much water throughout day.
And that was the issue. Anyway, I finally discovered the trick to make him drink enough water.</p>
