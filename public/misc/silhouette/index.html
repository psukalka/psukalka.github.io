    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Samu and I were playing in kid&rsquo;s play area, attached to parking space, of our society. The parking area has round track that can be used for walking. Sonal was walking there. Once in each round, she would pass by us (in the kid&rsquo;s playing area). Sonal was wearing a yellow gown and pink sweater over it.</p>
<p>Every time when Sonal would pass by Samu would get excited. He would spread  his arms wide open and let out delighted shrieks, bouncing on his bum in excitement as if asking her to pick him up. At times, Samu would recognize Sonal from her silhouette. There were other people too walking in the parking area but he never got excited at seeing them. When Sonal had passed by and we could only see her back, Samu could exactly recognize his mother from her pink sweater even when she was 10-15m away. He doesn&rsquo;t need to look at her face. He can recognize his mother even from back. Samu&rsquo;s memory and person recognition is improving rapidly.</p>
<p>At night, if I try to make him sleep and he recognizes that the light coming from door slit in adjacent room, he knows for sure that his mother is there. He would make every attempt in his capacity and throw all his tantrums so that I take him to that room.</p>
<p>There was an incident where he wanted to play with slipper but we didn&rsquo;t want him as it is dirty. Sonal kept her feet on the slipper so that he would not be able to lift it. His granny was calling him so he pretends to go towards granny and then again turns back to slipper in 10-15 sec. Seeing that Sonal was still there on the slipper he again turns towards granny. He listens to her for few seconds and then again looks back at slipper. This time Sonal is not near slipper so he crawls towards slipper and picks it. I was watching all this from the bed. The memory, planning and execution behind it at just 1yr age amazed me.</p>
<p>At times, it seems Samu is slower in action than other kids of his age but such instances make me wonder if he is much sharper than other kids. Only time will tell that, but it can&rsquo;t be denied that he has a sharp mind.</p>
