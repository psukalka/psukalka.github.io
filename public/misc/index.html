        Mobile Phone Addiction

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Samu is 1 year old now. As parents, we often get advised to keep child away from mobile phone as he would get addicted to it.
That is indeed true. If Samu sees any kid&rsquo;s video on youtube, he gets hooked to it. When the screen is turned off,
he screams as if why did you turn off the video.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t like classifying things as good or bad. There are actions and their consequences.
Samu likes youtube videos is a fact. I just try to utilize it to his benefit.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There was something off about Samu today. We had gone to Vikas&rsquo; home for his daughter&rsquo;s birthday.
Samu kept crying there every now and then. We also left the function early and were thinking of taking Samu to hospital.
Probably there was some issue with his stomach. Maybe gas or something, is what we assumed.</p>
<p>While driving back home, Samu&rsquo;s crying continued in car too. This is unusual for Samu. He usually does not cry in car.
So, we played his favorite <code>Aha Tamatar bade mazedar</code> song and he kept quiet for some time. But he needed constant feeding.
Sonal was also getting agitated by this behaviour as it was her period day.</p>

        Closing the door on Hope

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Sonal was doing her yoga in hall and Samu was quite active as it was morning.
He wanted to do everything but sleep. It is usually his nap time but he wasn&rsquo;t feeling sleepy.
So, I took him to guest room (which is attached to hall).
I was hip carrying Samu, strolling and singing <code>Are Kanha, Are Krishna</code> angaai (lullaby) so that he would sleep.</p>
<p>The room&rsquo;s door wasn&rsquo;t fully closed. So, everytime I would pass by that door opening, he could see his mummy (Sonal).
He would get active again and hopeful that his mum would come to carry him. He would stretch his neck to see more of his mum.
This happened few times. So, I decided to close the door completely.</p>

      <p>Will we be able to do such a long travel ? What if Samu falls sick and we need to rush to hospital ? Where will we find hospital in a new city ?
What if Sonal falls sick ? How will we take care of Samu ? What if I fall sick ? How will we come back without driving from so far ?
What if some accident happens and whole family is injured ? What if car breaks down in journey ? What if we encounter some thief ? &hellip; and what not.
All such negative thoughts were looming over head before the journey.</p>
