    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Samu is 1 year old now. As parents, we often get advised to keep child away from mobile phone as he would get addicted to it.
That is indeed true. If Samu sees any kid&rsquo;s video on youtube, he gets hooked to it. When the screen is turned off,
he screams as if why did you turn off the video.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t like classifying things as good or bad. There are actions and their consequences.
Samu likes youtube videos is a fact. I just try to utilize it to his benefit.</p>
<p>About two months back, I played youtube video on phone and Samu came crawling to me. So, I slided the phone in another corner of the room.
Samu crawled very fast and went near that corner. Interesting. So, I again slided phone in previous corner. Samu came crawling back.
So, this became a very good exercise for him. Usually he would just sit at one place playing something. But with this sliding exercise, I could give him good 15 min of crawling exercise.
He would be extremely happy throughout that time chasing the phone and exhausted at the end. He would then fall asleep after some time.</p>
<p>Same thing I used to make him stand. About a month back, while in gym I started a youtube video and keep it on a chair. To see the video Samu would crawl to the chair and try to stand up.
Once he stood up, I would lift the phone and keep it on another table. If the table is far, he would crawl there and then stand up again.
If the table is near, he would try to walk there by holding chair and all. So, I used his addiction to make him stand.</p>
<p>At times, when we are busy (like having dinner), desperately need some time and Samu is not letting us have it, I play a youtube video and hurl the phone on cot out of his reach for few minutes.
He just stands and enjoys the video from distance.</p>
<p>That is our case, but what makes mobile phone addiction a bad one ? After all, the world that we see around, isn&rsquo;t it also a video ?
Firstly, mobile phone would become the number one priority for kid. He wouldn&rsquo;t notice anything other than it.
If youtube video is being played, we (parents) don&rsquo;t exist for Samu. The video becomes his world.</p>
<p>Secondly, not all content on phone is appropriate for kids. We as parents might not be prepared to answer all questions that might arise from watching phone.
Payments / ordering stuff has been extremely easy with few clicks. So, money deduction is also one of the risk.</p>
<p>Most important I guess is that it would hamper child&rsquo;s development. Agreed that the world around is also a video, but to experience it the child has to make some effort.
He might chase a butterfly, he might catch a bug, he might play with dirt. All these involve movement of whole physical body. So, he is learning to coordinate his body parts.
He is learning to convert a thought into action. If in this development stage the child gets addicted to phone, his precious development time would be underutilized.
He would only be using his eyes, ears and brain. Whole other body parts would be rendered unutilized.</p>
<p>I tried utilizing his addiction for his benefit. But there can be some cons too that in future he gets even more addicted to it.
I can&rsquo;t avoid it as phone is a necessity, but I will have to teach him to use it in a responsible way rather than treating it as a taboo.
More importantly I would have to follow the advise as body language is what kids understand, not the verbal language.</p>
