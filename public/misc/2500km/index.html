    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Will we be able to do such a long travel ? What if Samu falls sick and we need to rush to hospital ? Where will we find hospital in a new city ?
What if Sonal falls sick ? How will we take care of Samu ? What if I fall sick ? How will we come back without driving from so far ?
What if some accident happens and whole family is injured ? What if car breaks down in journey ? What if we encounter some thief ? &hellip; and what not.
All such negative thoughts were looming over head before the journey.</p>
<p>But there were few legitimate concerns too. What all places to visit ? Will we be able to cover all the places in time ? How will Samu sleep without swing (palna)?
Will we be able to manage office with travel given that we don&rsquo;t have enough leaves ? How much budget will be needed for the journey ? How will we manage in rain ?
&hellip; and many more.</p>
<p>So, a lot of things had to be right for the journey to succeed. And it did. Because I had my lucky charm (Sonal) with me.
When she is with me everything eventually falls in right place.</p>
<p>The journey just started with the belief. The belief that destination is not important, journey is important. And that was indeed true.
The whole family (Sonal, Samu and I) was in the car, what else was needed. Wherever we go, we were complete by ourselves so the destination didn&rsquo;t matter.
We hadn&rsquo;t spent enough time together in months. So, journey mattered. And also <code>jab gaadi me petrol aur jeb me paisa ho to darne ki kya baat hain ??</code></p>
<p>Sonal loves travelling and she has been restricted from 1.5 yrs due to pregnancy (though she never complained about it).
The physical pressure of pregnancy, surgery, sleepless nights for feeding baby, whining of baby, 24x7 caring for it takes toll on your mind.
And having emotionless husband doesn&rsquo;t help in such situation. So, a break was needed.</p>
<p>When completing the journey itself is an achievement I had to set some rules for it not to fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel only during day time (there will be people to help out in day time)</li>
<li>Avoid shortcuts and crowdy places (as there was baby)</li>
<li>Do not stretch (travel max 300km daily)</li>
<li>Do not overspeed</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the conditions worse it had started raining heavily exactly one day before we were to start. We were to start journey on 16 Aug but it was flooding that day.
So, we started on 17 Aug. We had to leave in morning but it was already afternoon till we left. We were planning to go till Aurangabad but didn&rsquo;t want to travel in night.
So, stayed in Jalna as we had reached there by 8pm. There we stayed in Vijay Vilas Hotel. It was one of best hotel in Jalna. Once we entered the room Sonal and Samu jumped joyously on the bed.
Their happiness was overwhelming. Samu also was enjoying the comfy bed a lot. The stay and food was quite good in Jalna. Only problem was during eating.
When we both would eat Samu would start to cry so one had to eat and other had to take care of Samu.</p>
<p>Next day was Shravan Somavar so we had to go to Mahadev temple. But it was raining outside. Anyway we had car so we set out. But we were let at wrong places multiple times.
Eventually we found the right place and Sonal did her puja. She led the aarti in temple. She could recite many aartis while lot of elder ladies who had come there couldn&rsquo;t.
The admiration in their eyes for a young lady in salwar elated her. Joyous and satisfied, we reached the hotel packed our bags quickly and left the hotel. It was already 2 hours above checkout time, so we had to pay penalty.</p>
<p>Aurangabad was just 60km from Jalna so we decided to skip it and found next big city. It was Nashik. We left for Nashik around 3pm and reached around 7pm. Here we had a 2 day stay so hotel had to be nice.
We booked SSK Solitaire hotel, which seemed one of the posh hotels in Nashik. Before reaching Nashik I thought roads would be too curvy as maps was showing more time. But it was due to traffic in Nashik.
Nashik seemed like Pune. Too many cars and infra was also good. Definitely among top 5 cities in Maharashtra. The hotel was quite grand and food was also exquisite.</p>
<p>Next day we did our office and set out for market tour in evening. We did some shopping at flea market and bought diapers. Rain had picked more pace after 2 days. Water was released from nearby dam.
So, we decided not to take risk and stay one more day in Nashik. Samu was also now bored of the same room. So, we decided to change hotel in Nashik. We went to The Gateway (Taj Hotel).
The grandeur there was at another level. The whole hotel was spread out in acres. Hotel was only in around 1 acre and remaining were trees, golf course, swimming pool, &hellip;
Their welcome and genuiness touched us. At every hotel staff would come and try to play with Samu but the staff here asked if we would need any special cooked food for baby that will also be arranged.
They didn&rsquo;t try to overdo anything and let us enjoy by ourselves. We tried to enjoy all their facilities and felt what made Taj special. Unlike any other hotel their staff felt little experienced (in 30s-40s),
everyone seemed to have dedicated work and they felt naturally caring for guests. Natural flavours and scents were used wherever possible. When we left, the impression left by Taj was the greatest among all hotels.</p>
<p>It was still raining but we had to move on. It had already been 3 days in Nashik. From there we left for Daman. We booked The Fern resort near meeting point of Daman river and Arabian sea.
It was a beautiful resort but our timing was wrong. Rainy season made it terrible. The almost full river behind the tent frightened Sonal for Samu&rsquo;s safety.
Her thoughts were running wild. What if the river floods and enters our tent at night. I had to ensure her that nothing like that will happen.
Till you (my lucky charm) is with me, nothing bad will happen.</p>
<p>Our stay was quite brief in Daman. There also didn&rsquo;t seem much to do in Daman. While leaving, we captured some memories near sea and left for Surat. Surat has the biggest cloth market.
There is Surat textile market which is for wholesale and then Bombay market for retail users. The options were tremendous but Sonal didn&rsquo;t like much. We only bought one saree there.
Since we were quite hungry, we tried Gujarati thali for dinner. We stayed in De Glance hotel near railway station. The traffic in Surat had surprised us.
Too much than our expectation. Surat is also famous for diamond market but we couldn&rsquo;t visit that. Then we set for last stop in our journey: Kevadia.</p>
<p>This is were the Statue of Unity stands. The largest statue in world. Before reaching we didn&rsquo;t have much expectations from it. Road also from Surat to Kevadia reduced the expectations.
We didn&rsquo;t expect more than a garden around Narmada river. But when we went there it was tremendous. A whole tourist city has been built around it.
You can easily spend whole day in Kevadia so many activities have been added there. It is a very good weekend getaway. It is called Ekta Nagar (hindi for Unity).
Since it was rainy season few of the river activities like rafting were cancelled. We stayed at Ramada hotel from whose window we could wake up to view of Narmada river.
The view was mesmerizing in morning. Cars are not allowed near statue. Free electric buses ply from hotel to the statue (which is around 6km). We enjoyed our whole day around statue, valley of flowers, glow garden and laser show at night.
Kevadia was our last stop and it was worth it.</p>
<p>Next day we started on our return journey. We had to go to Dhule. The boundary between Maharashtra and Gujarat has ghat road of around 80km. We left around 12pm and reached by 6pm in Dhule.
While inside Dhule, finally we met with our accident on the journey. There was a big drainage hole in the road and front left tyre of our car went straight into it.
Some of the residents there came running for help. They were lifting car from front and asked me to pull car in reverse gear. With their guidance we were out of the accident which might have blown too much.
We thanked them for their timely help and went to our Gold Leaf Resort. The stay here was again quite good. We just rested there for night and next morning set on journey for home.
With 550km on last day we finally reached home at 9pm.</p>
<p>Overall the trip was around 2500km but the memories would be lasting a lifetime. Completing the journey itself has been an achievement. It was all possible due to my better half.
While I was driving she was carrying a 10kg baby in her hands. Samu would be irritated at times, start crying, just sleep sometimes, &hellip; she beared it all. Everyday she bathed Samu despite heavy rains outside.
The journey was a success due to her efforts. Otherwise who knows, we might have turned back from Jalna itself&hellip;</p>
