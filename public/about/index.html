<p>I am <strong>Pavan Sukalkar</strong> and this is my diary (though public). I like to call it diary rather than blog because it is primarily intended for me, I haven&rsquo;t enabled comments on it, though I like to share some entries with friends. Professionally, I work as a Software Engineer so my observations are mainly focused, but not restricted, to software.</p>
