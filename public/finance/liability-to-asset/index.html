    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>WFH days were over when we were called to office. I had got an extension of 6 months since we were expecting a child. In the meantime, I had to come to Bengaluru for office visits. During these visits, I checked about rents in Bengaluru. They had significantly shot up. Even a 1BHK would have been fine for me, but it did not come with car parking. So, I had to search for 2BHK. In a decent society it shot up to anywhere Rs 40k - Rs 50k.</p>
<p>I was ok for rent upto 30k but giving 50k for someone else&rsquo;s flat just didn&rsquo;t feel right. Rather than paying a rent of 50k I would have preferred paying an EMI of same amount. That would translate to a loan of about Rs 60L.</p>
<p>So, first I started searching 1BHK under Rs 50L. There weren&rsquo;t many good options. Most were old or in constricted spaces. I didn&rsquo;t have lavish expectations but at least I can ask for a covered parking. That is not aspirational.</p>
<p>I searched for options on MagicBricks and other sites. I was surprised to see options around Rs 1cr in Prestige giving a rental yield of more than 5%. But after further investigations, I came to know that they were trap or bogus posts. Actual price was around Rs 2cr.</p>
<p>Then in Jan 2025, after my baby was born we were about to leave Pune. I got a call for a Shapoorji Pallonji project in Pune. It also had a 1BHK option. It would cost me around Rs 52L (all inclusive) for a ready to move in flat. It was an aspirational flat with all the amenities and parking located near an IT park. So, it was a no brainer for me. And I booked it.</p>
<p>Fast forward two months, I have got the possession of the flat. I did some electrical fitting, kitchen trolley and cupboard which costed around Rs 1.5L</p>
<p>I have now rented the flat for Rs 16k / month with a security deposit of Rs 34k. I would have got Rs 17k but didn&rsquo;t want to let the flat vacant for long. I had taken a loan of Rs 40L for the flat. Its EMI of 35k has started. While buying I felt like stretching as it was my 3rd flat. But now I have breathing space. Repo rate has also decreased and government has increased tax exemptions. The same flat would cost Rs 60L in few months time.</p>
<p>After few months, when I shift to a 2BHK apartment around Rs 40k, I would still be paying an EMI of Rs 35k and getting back rent of Rs 16k. So essentially I would be shelling 40+35-16 = 59k . But I would have an asset to show for it. That&rsquo;s how you turn a Rs 50k liability into a Rs 50k asset.</p>
<p>Given the nature of my job where I may need to shift to any metro city or at different location in the same city, I always looked at flat as an interchangeable commodity. If my flat is 20km from my office location, I would rather prefer to rent it to someone and stay on rent in some place near my office.</p>
