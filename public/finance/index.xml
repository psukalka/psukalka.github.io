      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-itch&#34;&gt;The Itch&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Few Years ago, I used to invest in Share Market. Every morning, I used to open the app around 9am and start tracking the movements. I used to save Rs 10-12k to invest in market for that month. Depending on how the market is moving, I would buy few shares. When I bought some share and at end of day I earned even few rupees profit, it would make me happy. It was an achievement. Throughout the day I would fidget around the trading app checking if there has been any positive movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-or-rent-a-flat&#34;&gt;Buy Or Rent A Flat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been lucky enough to be born in a state that has two major finance power houses of country. Mumbai and Pune. Rents in these cities are already quite high. A 2bhk costs around Rs. 20,000/- . While in my home town our whole house generates around Rs. 15,000/- rent. The point is, if you have something in a big city you can easily live in small city with its rent but vice versa is not true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
