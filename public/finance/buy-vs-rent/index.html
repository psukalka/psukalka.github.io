    <meta name="description" content="Buy Or Rent A Flat
I have been lucky enough to be born in a state that has two major finance power houses of country. Mumbai and Pune. Rents in these cities are already quite high. A 2bhk costs around Rs. 20,000/- . While in my home town our whole house generates around Rs. 15,000/- rent. The point is, if you have something in a big city you can easily live in small city with its rent but vice versa is not true.">
