    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I had been eating outside or in office from past few months. Everything was going well but I started to feel few issues.</p>
<p>When food is free (like office dinner), I tend to eat more and then can&rsquo;t sleep well at night.
Eating daily outside, I started to burp a lot. The burps had foul smell. This didn&rsquo;t feel right. So I decided to take control of what I eat.</p>
<p>So, I made a rule <em>to eat only what I cooked</em>.</p>
<p>It takes me 30-45 minutes to cook a meal. Usually dal-chawal, sabji-roti, kadhi-pulav, &hellip; I do have curd, salad or papad at times.
Sometimes even banana or apple before eating as an appetizer.</p>
<p>It was going well. To keep it going well I had to incentivise it.
Whenever I cooked food I used to save Rs. 100 in a jar. Generally Rs 100 in morning and Rs 100 in evening.
And just like that in 15-20 days I had collected Rs 3000. The money was accumulating quickly so I had to think about utilizing it.
Just sitting in jar the money would not grow so I started thinking ways to utilize it.</p>
<p>I had been planning to make monthly installments to my PPF account since Feb. The maturity amount is to be utilized in repaying a home loan. But I hadn&rsquo;t been able to make any contribution for 5 months. So I matched the saved amount and made contribution to PPF.
Just like that I have been able to add Rs 18k to PPF account in 2 months.</p>
<p>Thus, just a simple change solved multiple issues for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I now don&rsquo;t get burps or any indigestion issues when I eat food cooked by me. I use a lot of oil still things seem under control.
I am in charge of what goes inside my belly. Also since I have to cook food I now eat only how much is needed.
At times I do eat outside for a change but I make contribution to jar only when I cook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contribution from cooking has solved my PPF problem.
To reach desired maturity amount from PPF I had to make Rs. 1L yearly contribution but I wasn&rsquo;t being able to make any monthly contribution. This would have put pressure on my budget around Jan-March time. This has been taken care of now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since I have to reach office on time even after cooking, I need to have some morning schedule. I have to start cooking latest by 8:30am so I have to be prepared before that. Cooking does not require your attention all the time. There are gaps of 15 min where rice is cooking or dough is resting. I bathe or do puja during this time thus increasing my speed. Sometimes it feels tiresome to cook in evening but the fear of going hungry to bed motivates me. I generally cook pulav or eat fruit at such time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far so good. There is a history of me leaving things after a while. So, I have tried to fill that gap with monetary incentive this time. Let&rsquo;s see how far it goes this time.</p>
