GHF provided me upto 94% of loan while regular bank won&rsquo;t go beyond 80%.</p>
<p>Fast forward 2 years, government is reducing repo rate consistently. In past one year, repo rate has come down by 1.25%. But same hasn&rsquo;t been the case with GHF loan. Its interest rate has come down just by 0.25% . My other bank loans (from HDFC and SBI) have reduced their interest rates by 1.25% and that too in the same month when repo rate announcement was made.</p>
<p>I have tried reaching GHF multiple times to reduce the interest rate otherwise I would transfer the loan to another bank. They are ok with it, but rate will not budge.</p>
<p>Transferring loan from one bank to another isn&rsquo;t also that straight forward. First there will be processing fees, stamp duty charges, &hellip; Last I checked this for ICICI Bank, it came around 1.3% of the home loan which is roughly Rs. 1L . That doesn&rsquo;t hurt that much. The second part where the insurance would go away and I will have to buy new insurance hurts more.</p>
<p>In GHF I had to pay Rs. 1.86L for insurance. If I transfer loan to another bank, this insurance too will go away. And further I will have to buy insurance (though of some lesser amount) from that bank. Overall it would be a loss of Rs. 3-4L in transferring the loan. So, I haven&rsquo;t been able to transfer the loan till now.</p>
<p>Once, I get the possession of the flat I will transfer the loan to other bank. Because after that I will be aggressively repaying the loan and each extra decimal in interest rate will matter.</p>
<p>So, it is important to select right bank while taking home loan. Had I taken home loan from HDFC / SBI I would have saved few thousands over past few months.</p>
