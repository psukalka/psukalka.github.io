<p>Valkey is a fork of Redis. Valkey is open source. Till now they both are almost similar but going forward they will diverge. Redis will be managed by Redis Ltd and Valkey will be managed by the Linux Foundation with backing from cloud providers (AWS, Google, Oracle, etc.) Thus, features in Valkey will be community driven.
Since Valkey is open source it is cheaper (on cloud).</p>
<p>Currently migrating from Redis to Valkey is trivial:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Before
connection = redis.connect(&#34;redis://localhost:6379&#34;)

# After  
connection = redis.connect(&#34;valkey://localhost:6379&#34;)
</code></pre><p>Valkey and redis can be swapped with minimal differences:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Redis
redis-server
redis-cli

# Valkey  
valkey-server
valkey-cli

# Commands, data structures, protocols - all the same (for now)
</code></pre><p>If you are using Redis on cloud, switching to valkey is a cheaper alternative as of now.</p>
