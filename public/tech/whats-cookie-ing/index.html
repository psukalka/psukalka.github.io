Cloudfront provides two approaches: one using signed urls and the other using signed cookies. The later suits better for our media usecase where there are lot of fragmented files.</p>
<p>Anyway, I generated a privately signed cookie and sent it in an API response. Then I used this in sending an API request from Postman. And voila it worked. POC was successful.</p>
<p>Now, it was time for integrating cookie in web player. FE sent the same cookie as was returned in API response. Surprisingly, web player was getting <code>403 Access Denied</code> error now. Same way worked in postman but not in web.</p>
<p>First hunch was that CDN was dropping the headers. So, we updated the distribution policy to allow all headers. But that didn&rsquo;t work. Chrome didn&rsquo;t allow to set cookie like this when accessing a third party resource.</p>
<p>So, we then decided to change the approach. Instead of sending the cookie in an API response, I sent it as a cookie response. Django sent <code>Set-Cookie</code> in response. In cookie, we set the allowed domain to <code>.cloudfront.net</code> as we wanted to access Cloudfront resource. Tested the solution in Postman. It worked.</p>
<p>It was time for round 2 in Web Player. And it again failed. There was some yellow warning when we were checking the cookie in <code>Application</code> tab in dev tools. It wasn&rsquo;t allowing to set cross site cookies. Meaning I can&rsquo;t set cookie for <code>.cloudfront.net</code> from my <code>.example.com</code> domain.</p>
<p>Another setback. What to do now ? So, we created another domain name reference <code>media.cdn.example.com</code> (through CNAME record) to access our resources.</p>
<p>This time, browser allowed to set cookies. And finally we were able to access the CDN resource using cookie from web player.</p>
<p>This made me realize the various levels of security that browser implements to prevent users from malicious attacks.</p>
