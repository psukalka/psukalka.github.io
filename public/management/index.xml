      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m helping a friend in managing his tech venture. He got the project built with a Consultancy Service and they have done quite a good job. When I started on the project it was a live app working in production. I had to manage the tech team given that the consultants had now done their job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Codebase was in Python (Django) which I am already familiar with from my office work. I started going through the codebase. I understood the flows in a few days. I started giving time after office hours while their team used to work in daytime. So, there was no syncing between me and the team. Neither did I have any test app build that I could use to identify important API flows. On top of that everything seemed to work, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any way to barge in. As a production project whatever I would imagine should be in place was already there and even better than I would think in some places. When something is working, it is difficult to make your way in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
