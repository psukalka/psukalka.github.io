I have been hearing a lot about `Rust` lately. How it is fast and achieves near C/C++ performance. So, I was thinking of usecases where I can use it. 

I have been using Python (at work) for many years now. Python is a good starting point to embody business ideas as it significantly reduces development time. Libraries are readily available for almost all use cases. 

But when your product is built and is handling traffic at scale, you need to go deeper. Python can be a barrier too sometimes. We have migrated one of our high-traffic module from Python (Django) to Java (Spring Webflux) and have seen a 5x impovement in response times. That got me thinking about other options too and eventual interest in `Rust`. 

When you build things for production environment, language speed is not the only thing that matters. Community support, frameworks, libraries, availability of developers, maintainability of code, ... all play significant role. So, Python will still exist in our project though performance critical modules can be migrated to some other languages.

I have also been preparing for interviews with my colleague. I find solving DSA problems quite boring. Spending time on problems that hardly have any real-life implications is boring. 

Then I got the `Rust-ic` idea to make it interesting. Why not club DSA with Rust ? Whichever problem that I solve will always be in some new language (Rust/ Go). That way I would at least gain by learning new language and DSA will also be done. A win-win situation for me.

Hence forth, I will solve all DSA problems in some new programming language.
