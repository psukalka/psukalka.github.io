# The Itch
Few Years ago, I used to invest in Share Market. Every morning, I used to open the app around 9am and start tracking the movements. I used to save Rs 10-12k to invest in market for that month. Depending on how the market is moving, I would buy few shares. When I bought some share and at end of day I earned even few rupees profit, it would make me happy. It was an achievement. Throughout the day I would fidget around the trading app checking if there has been any positive movement. 

Few years later, I started investing my money through RD and SIP. The amount used to get deducted from my bank account at scheduled time. Money automatically would be invested. It was a steady growth and actually I used to feel calm throughout the day. No fidgeting around any app as there is no daily movement. 

Though the amount used to be invested timely and it was growing, there was some itch. It felt that I'm not doing anything. Money was growing by itself and it seemed I didn't have any role in it. That would make me feel restless. This continued for few months. After few months of timely deductions the accumulated amount started becoming significant. When it crossed monthly salary, the itch was gone. 

That's how money grows. Initially, it is just about disciplined investment. Even if you investment Rs. 10k and it grows by 100% it will only be Rs. 20k (which would not make any significant difference). But if the investment has been Rs. 10L and even if it grows by 10% (which is highly probable), it would be an increment of Rs. 1L . An investment of Rs. 5cr growing at 10% would mean Rs. 50L in return. It means you would be better off managing your own money rather than working for others. In short, you can retire. 

The itch is just to make you feel relevant. As if you have done some work in growing the money. While indeed money begets money.
